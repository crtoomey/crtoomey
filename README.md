## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Colin Toomey and I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional. I graduate from SUNY Canton with a B.S. in Cybersecurity in July, 2024. If you would like to reach out to me, please contact me via LinkedIn or email.
For more information about me, projects that I am working on, and the sword/shield blog, please visit my website: https://crtoomey.github.io/

## Learning

I am currently in college at SUNY Canton where I am taking a variety of cybersecurity courses that include hands-on labs and activities. I have taken ethical hacking courses, incident response courses, access control and authentication courses, and more. I am also preparing to take the CompTIA Network+ exam to expand my knowledge of networking which is a vital component of information systems. I have recently been learning more about web development and specifically React web applications as I work on a cryptology project.

## Projects and Labs

I am currently working on projectCaesar, a web application that uses a variety of encryption and hashing algorithms to create a cipher text from plaintext. projectCaesar will also output every step of the encryption algorithm to help those who are learning cryptology in school or are just interested in general. I am also always working on write-ups of CTFs and cybersecurity labs. More information can be found on the [sword/shield blog](https://crtoomey.github.io/blog/) on my website. I have some ideas of what I want to do after projectCaesar so if you're interested, follow me here or on other social media.
